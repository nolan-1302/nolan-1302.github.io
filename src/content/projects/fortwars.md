In Open Forts you build and fight. During the building stage you're allowed to build with props to help fortify your base. During the fighting stage, two or four teams battle to take control of the flag. Once one of the team retreives the enemy's teams flag 3 mins, they win.

Fortwars took about a week of work and with more work being put into polish.
