I started programming around a year ago. Since then I've made games, wrote websites from scratch, and coded discord bots. I thought I would take the time to detail my programming journey since then. It's also interesting to see how s&box evolved as a whole.

Only & Up was my first ever programming project. I wouldn't call it programming though, it was more like copy-pasting facepunch code and begging [Carson](https://carsonk.net) to help me. You could platform around the world with facepunch's player controller component.

Survive Terry was a 2d game I made. It was surprisingly good for my skill at the time. It had leaderboard support. You could jump around and kill zombies with different weapons. I got help with the menu from [k&woz](https://scoutwozniak.github.io/). [Here's one hour of gameplay this one guy recorded.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpIaOasIBqM)

<LastEdited date="Feb 2024" />

This is by far my biggest game, it has almost 10k players. Although, I have no idea why. It was so bad I had to rewrite it about a year later. It's a zombie shooter that ran like shit. I made the name as a joke since the [Team Fortress Source 2 DMCA](https://www.pcgamer.com/fan-made-team-fortress-2-remake-using-the-source-2-engine-shuts-down-for-good-after-receiving-a-dmca-notice-from-valve/) happened at the time.

<LastEdited date="Mar 2024" />

I coded a discord bot and backend for this. Kicks Coin was a play on Ape Coin which was a currency another discord server made to play blackback with. The bot and backend were coded in JS.

<LastEdited date="Mar 2024" />

I made rock paper scissors in sbox using the coins I used for my discord bot. They shared the same backend and people could use coins on the bot or in game.

I made Melon Racer, a classic Garry's Mod gamemode, in s&box. You roll around as a melon and race. I added mutliplayer so people can play together.

<Header title="Open World Game" />

<LastEdited date="Apr 2024" />

I set out to make an open world gamemode with randomly generated worlds. I worked on this project for months, but it turned out to just be a demo though. I got an SDF proceedual world demo thing working with a few premade levels.

<Header title="Prop Hunt" />

<LastEdited date="Jul 2024" />

I worked on this project for almost the whole summer. It's based off of classic Prop Hunt games. It works... kinda. It did at the time, but it began to break. It runs really bad, but without this project, I don't think I would be where I am today without it. After this I think the projects I started to work on are genuinely good games.

<LastEdited date="Aug 2024" />

I joined this project about a month after Yart started working on it. This might be my most happy time working on games. I really enjoyed learning from a more experienced programmer. I learned so much. I would be not be close in skill to where I am now without this project.

<Header title="Dead 4 Left Rewrite" />

<LastEdited date="Sep 2024" />

I rewrote Dead 4 Left because it was really bad and it has a shit ton of players.

<LastEdited date="Oct 2024" />

I wrote this website in Svelte Kit, TS, and tailwind css.

<Header title="Fortwars" />

<LastEdited date="Nov 2024" />

This is my current project, I am working on it with a small team of contributors. It has a few gamemodes such as deathmatch, capture the flag, and classic GMod fortwars. We have some cool plans for this, stay tuned : )

<Header title="Conclusion" />

I can't believe how far I've come, from not knowing know to program to being able to make shit. I'm so excited for what this next year will bring and I will look back fondly on everything so far.
