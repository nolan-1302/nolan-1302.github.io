Ever since I wrote [this website](newsite), I've felt myself struggle to find something to work on next. I patched together a version of [Prop Hunt](https://sbox.game/nolankicks/prophunt) in a few hours, but I never felt fully motivated to work on it. The owner of the [org](https://sbox.game/vidya) I'm apart of joined [Small Fish](https://smallfi.sh) (happy for you man), since then I've began to reconsider what I want to do next.

I love s&box, I think it's such a great engine, but recently I've began to lack motivation to work on projects in it. I've enjoyed continuing to work on [Fortwars](/projects/fortwars), but it's hard to continue working on something when s&box has a total of 4 active players. (not actually, it seems like that though). With the current state of s&box, it's hard to get a constant player base. Although, I did recently join a new project which I'm looking forward too.

I've had a great time working on this website, I love learning new skills and improving. So who knows what I will work on next, more s&box, more TypeScript, or learning C++, probably a little bit of everything.
